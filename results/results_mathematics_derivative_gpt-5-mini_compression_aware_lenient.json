      "response": "Definition and basic meaning\n- The derivative of f at x, written f'(x), is the limit\n  f'(x) = lim_{h\u21920} (f(x+h) \u2212 f(x))/h\n  when that limit exists. It measures how the output f(x) changes for an infinitesimal change in the input x.\n- Geometric interpretation: f'(x) is the slope of the tangent line to the graph y = f(x) at the point (x, f(x)).\n- Physical/interpretive meaning: for a position function s(t), s'(t) is instantaneous velocity; in general, a derivative is an instantaneous rate of change.\n\nBasic differentiation rules (what to use to compute derivatives)\n- Sum and constant multiple: (af + bg)' = a f' + b g'.\n- Power rule: d/dx[x^n] = n x^{n\u22121} for integer or real n where defined.\n- Product rule: d/dx[ f(x) g(x) ] = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x).\n- Quotient rule: d/dx[ f/g ] = (f' g \u2212 f g')/g^2 (g \u2260 0).\n- Chain rule: d/dx[ F(G(x)) ] = F'(G(x)) \u00b7 G'(x). (Used whenever a function is composed of an \u201couter\u201d and an \u201cinner\u201d function.)\n- These rules, applied repeatedly, let you differentiate most standard algebraic, exponential, logarithmic and many trigonometric functions.\n\nWorked examples\n- Power rule: d/dx[x^3] = 3x^2.\n- Chain rule: if f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^3 then f'(x) = 3(x^2 + 1)^2 \u00b7 2x = 6x(x^2 + 1)^2.\n- Product rule: if h(x) = x^3 e^x then h'(x) = 3x^2 e^x + x^3 e^x = e^x(3x^2 + x^3).\n\nHigher derivatives and Taylor approximation\n- Higher-order derivatives: f'', f''', \u2026 measure successive rates of change (acceleration, jerk, \u2026).\n- Linearization (first-order Taylor): near a, f(x) \u2248 f(a) + f'(a)(x \u2212 a). This is the tangent-line approximation.\n- Higher-order Taylor polynomials give increasingly accurate polynomial approximations using f, f', f'', \u2026\n\nDifferentiability vs continuity and singularities\n- If f is differentiable at a point then f is continuous there. The converse is false: a function can be continuous but not differentiable (e.g., f(x) = |x| at x = 0 has a corner).\n- Non-differentiable situations include corners/cusps, vertical tangents, or wild oscillation.\n\nImportant theorems and tests\n- Rolle\u2019s theorem and the Mean Value Theorem: if f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), there exists c in (a,b) with f'(c) = (f(b) \u2212 f(a))/(b \u2212 a). These give deep information about how values and slopes relate and underpin many proofs.\n- Critical points: points where f'(x) = 0 or f' is undefined. Candidates for local maxima or minima.\n- First and second derivative tests:\n  - First derivative test uses sign changes of f' around a critical point to classify it.\n  - Second derivative test: if f'(a)=0 and f''(a)>0 then local minimum; if f''(a)<0 then local maximum. If f''(a)=0 the test is inconclusive.\n\nSpecial techniques\n- Implicit differentiation: differentiate both sides of relations like F(x,y)=0 treating y as a function of x, then solve for dy/dx.\n- Logarithmic differentiation: take logs to simplify differentiation of products, quotients, or functions raised to variable powers.\n- Differentiation of inverse functions: if y = f^{-1}(x) and f'(f^{-1}(x)) \u2260 0 then (f^{-1})'(x) = 1 / f'(f^{-1}(x)).\n\nApplications\n- Motion: position \u2192 velocity \u2192 acceleration.\n- Optimization: maximize or minimize quantities by finding critical points and testing endpoints.\n- Related rates: use implicit differentiation to relate rates of change of linked quantities (e.g., radius and volume).\n- Linear approximation and error estimation: small changes \u2248 f'(a)\u0394x; higher-order Taylor polynomials give more precise approximations.\n\nPractical tips for computing derivatives\n- Simplify the function first when possible; identify compositions and products to pick the correct rule.\n- Check the domain (division by zero, log of nonpositive, etc.) and endpoints when solving optimization problems.\n- For complicated expressions combine chain, product and quotient rules as needed; consider logarithmic differentiation for messy products/powers.\n\nSummary\nThe derivative is a fundamental tool that quantifies instantaneous rate of change and slope of the tangent line. Its formal limit definition gives the rigorous foundation; a small set of rules (power, product, quotient, chain) plus special techniques (implicit, logarithmic) let you compute derivatives in practice. Derivatives are central in geometry, physics, optimization, approximation, and many areas of applied and pure mathematics.",
