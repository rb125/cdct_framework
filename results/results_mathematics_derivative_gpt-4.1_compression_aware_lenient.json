      "response": "A derivative is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes how a function changes as its input changes. In other words, it measures the rate at which the output of a function responds to small changes in the input. Formally, the derivative of a function f at a point x is defined as:\n\nf'(x) = lim[h\u21920] (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h\n\nThis limit, if it exists, gives the instantaneous rate of change of the function at x. Geometrically, the derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.\n\nThere are several important rules for calculating derivatives:\n\n- **Power Rule:** For functions of the form x^n, the derivative is d/dx[x^n] = n x^(n-1).\n- **Product Rule:** For the product of two functions f(x) and g(x), the derivative is d/dx[fg] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).\n- **Chain Rule:** For a composition of functions f(g(x)), the derivative is d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n\nDerivatives have many practical applications:\n\n- **Velocity:** The derivative of position with respect to time gives velocity, showing how position changes over time.\n- **Optimization:** Derivatives are used to find maxima and minima of functions, which occur where the derivative equals zero (f'(x) = 0).\n- **Approximation:** Derivatives allow us to approximate functions near a point using linearization, which uses the tangent line as a simple model of the function's behavior.\n\nIn summary, derivatives provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing how quantities change, both in mathematics and in real-world applications.",
