      "response": "Impressionism was an innovative art movement that began in France during the 1860s, marking a significant break from traditional academic painting. Rather than focusing on historical or mythological subjects and polished, detailed techniques, Impressionist artists sought to capture the fleeting effects of light, atmosphere, and modern life as they experienced it.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Light and Color Primacy:** Impressionists prioritized the depiction of changing light conditions. Instead of using black for shadows, they painted shadows with colors, reflecting how light interacts with surfaces in real life.\n\n2. **Broken Color Technique:** They applied unmixed, pure colors side-by-side on the canvas. This allowed the viewer\u2019s eye to blend the colors optically, creating vibrant effects and a sense of immediacy.\n\n3. **Visible Brushwork:** Impressionist paintings are characterized by short, broken brushstrokes. These visible marks convey movement, energy, and the artist\u2019s presence, rather than hiding the process behind a smooth finish.\n\n4. **En Plein Air Painting:** Many Impressionists painted outdoors (\u201cen plein air\u201d) to observe and record the direct effects of sunlight and atmosphere, rather than relying on studio sketches.\n\n5. **Modern Life Subjects:** Instead of grand historical scenes, Impressionists depicted contemporary life\u2014caf\u00e9s, railways, leisure activities in parks and suburbs\u2014reflecting the changing society of 19th-century France.\n\n**Key Artists and Works:**\n- **Claude Monet** painted series like haystacks and cathedrals at different times of day to study light\u2019s effects.\n- **Pierre-Auguste Renoir** captured dappled sunlight filtering through trees and scenes of social gatherings.\n- **Edgar Degas** explored movement and unusual viewpoints, often painting dancers and urban scenes.\n- **Camille Pissarro** focused on rural landscapes and village life.\n\nThe movement\u2019s name comes from Monet\u2019s painting *Impression, Sunrise* (1872), which was initially mocked for its \u201cunfinished\u201d look.\n\n**Influences:**\n- **Photography** inspired spontaneity and new ways of framing scenes.\n- **Japanese prints** influenced composition, cropping, and the use of flat areas of color.\n- **Scientific color theory** (like Chevreul\u2019s work) informed their use of color relationships and optical effects.\n\n**Reception and Legacy:**\nImpressionist works were often rejected by the official Salon, criticized for their loose technique and lack of finish. However, Impressionism ultimately revolutionized art by liberating color from strict representation, emphasizing perception and experience over detailed realism. It paved the way for later movements such as Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Abstract art.\n\nA related development, **Neo-Impressionism** (led by Georges Seurat), systematized Impressionist color theory into Pointillism, using tiny dots of color to build images.\n\nIn summary, Impressionism transformed art by focusing on the artist\u2019s immediate impression of a scene, using innovative techniques to capture the vibrancy and transience of modern life.",
