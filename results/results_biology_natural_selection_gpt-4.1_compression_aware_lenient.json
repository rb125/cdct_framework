      "response": "Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution, first described by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. It explains how populations change over time due to differences in individuals\u2019 traits. The process relies on four key requirements:\n\n1. **Variation**: Individuals within a population have different traits (phenotypes), such as size, color, or behavior.\n2. **Heritability**: These traits can be passed from parents to offspring through genetic inheritance.\n3. **Selection Pressure**: Environmental factors (like predators, climate, or food availability) create challenges that favor certain traits over others.\n4. **Differential Fitness**: Individuals with traits better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits to the next generation.\n\nOver time, this leads to adaptation\u2014populations become better suited to their environments. Natural selection can operate in different ways:\n- **Directional selection** shifts the average trait in one direction (e.g., larger beaks if food requires cracking tough seeds).\n- **Stabilizing selection** favors average traits and reduces variation (e.g., intermediate birth weights in humans).\n- **Disruptive selection** favors extreme traits at both ends of the spectrum (e.g., very small and very large beaks, but not medium-sized).\n\nNatural selection acts on existing variation; it does not create new traits or work toward a predetermined goal. It can lead to changes within species (**microevolution**) or, over long periods, to the formation of new species (**macroevolution**).\n\nEvidence for natural selection comes from the fossil record (showing gradual changes), comparative anatomy (similar structures in related species), molecular biology (shared DNA sequences), and direct observation (such as bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance or finches adapting to new food sources).\n\nThe **modern synthesis** of evolutionary theory combines natural selection with genetics, defining evolution as a change in allele frequencies within a population over time.\n\nCommon misconceptions include the idea that natural selection is \u201csurvival of the strongest\u201d\u2014in reality, it is about survival and reproduction of those best adapted to current conditions. It does not act with foresight or design, but simply favors traits that increase fitness in a given environment.\n\nIn summary, natural selection is a process that explains how species adapt and diversify, driven by genetic variation, inheritance, environmental pressures, and differential reproductive success.",
