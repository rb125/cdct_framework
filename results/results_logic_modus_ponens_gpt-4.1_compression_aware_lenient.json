      "response": "**Modus ponens** is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic, often referred to as the \"method of affirming.\" It allows one to validly deduce a conclusion from two premises:\n\n1. **Conditional statement:** If P, then Q (symbolically, P\u2192Q).\n2. **Affirmation of the antecedent:** P is true.\n\nGiven these, modus ponens lets us conclude:\n\n- **Q is true.**\n\n**Symbolic notation:**  \n((P\u2192Q) \u2227 P) \u22a2 Q  \nor  \n{P\u2192Q, P} \u22a2 Q\n\nThis means: If both \"P implies Q\" and \"P\" are true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n**Why is it valid?**  \nModus ponens is *truth-preserving*: if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. It is a core part of deductive reasoning and is used in mathematical proofs, automated theorem proving, expert systems, and legal reasoning. In artificial intelligence, it underpins *forward chaining* in rule-based systems.\n\n**Natural deduction:**  \nIn formal logic systems, modus ponens is the *elimination rule* for implication: it allows us to \"eliminate\" the implication and assert the consequent.\n\n**Distinction from related fallacies:**  \n- *Affirming the consequent* ((P\u2192Q) \u2227 Q) \u22a2 P is **invalid**; knowing Q is true does not guarantee P.\n- *Denying the antecedent* ((P\u2192Q) \u2227 \u00acP) \u22a2 \u00acQ is **invalid**; knowing P is false does not guarantee Q is false.\n\n**Related valid form:**  \n- *Modus tollens*: If (P\u2192Q) and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\n**Philosophical significance:**  \nModus ponens embodies the essence of deductive reasoning. Immanuel Kant described it as \"analytic,\" meaning the conclusion is contained within the premises.\n\n**Limitations:**  \nModus ponens assumes classical logic. In non-classical systems, such as quantum logic, it may not always hold.\n\n**Historical context:**  \nThe rule was known to ancient Stoic philosophers, formalized by medieval scholastics, and is central to modern symbolic logic.\n\n**Summary:**  \nModus ponens is a basic, reliable logical rule: if \"If P then Q\" and \"P\" are both true, then \"Q\" must be true. It is foundational to logical reasoning in mathematics, philosophy, computer science, and beyond.",
