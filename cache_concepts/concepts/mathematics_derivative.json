Formally, the derivative of a function \\( f(x) \\) at a point \\( x \\) is defined as the limit:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n\\]\n\nprovided this limit exists. The derivative embodies the concept of instantaneous rate of change and is fundamental to differential calculus. Key principles include linearity, the product and quotient rules, and the chain rule for composite functions. Geometrically, the derivative at a point corresponds to the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. Applications of derivatives are widespread, including optimization, motion analysis, curve sketching, and modeling dynamic systems in physics, engineering, and economics.",
