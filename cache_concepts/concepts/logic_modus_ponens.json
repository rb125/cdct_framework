Formally, modus ponens is represented as:  \n1. P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)  \n2. P (P is true)  \n\u2234 Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\nThe key principle underlying modus ponens is the preservation of truth: given the truth of both premises, the conclusion follows with certainty. This rule is essential in deductive reasoning, mathematical proofs, and automated theorem proving, where it enables the derivation of new truths from established premises. Modus ponens is widely applied in computer science (e.g., programming language semantics), philosophy, and formal systems, serving as a cornerstone for logical argumentation and proof construction.",
