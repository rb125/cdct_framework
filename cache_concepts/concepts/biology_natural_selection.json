These beneficial alleles become more common in the gene pool over generations. For example, peppered moths in polluted areas evolved darker coloration, better matching their environment and avoiding predators. This process drives populations to become better suited to their ecological niches.",

      "text": "Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution in biology, whereby heritable traits that confer a survival or reproductive advantage become more common in a population over successive generations. It operates on genetic variation within populations, which arises from mutations, genetic recombination, and other sources. The key principles of natural selection include variation (individuals differ in traits), differential survival and reproduction (some traits enhance fitness), and heredity (advantageous traits are passed to offspring). Over time, natural selection can lead to adaptation, where populations become better suited to their environments. This process explains phenomena such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the development of camouflage in animals, and the diversification of species. Natural selection is central to fields like evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation, providing a scientific framework for understanding the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.",
