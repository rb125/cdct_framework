The key principles of recursion include the base case, which terminates the recursive process, and the recursive case, which reduces the problem\u2019s complexity with each call. Properly defined base cases prevent infinite loops and stack overflows. Recursion leverages the call stack to manage function calls and intermediate states. It is particularly effective for problems exhibiting self-similarity, such as tree traversals, factorial computation, and the Fibonacci sequence. Recursion simplifies code for algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and depth-first search in graphs. However, excessive recursion may lead to performance issues due to stack limitations. Understanding recursion is fundamental for algorithm design, enabling elegant solutions to problems that are naturally recursive in structure.",
