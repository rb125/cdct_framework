Notation: phonemes in slashes /p/, phones in brackets [p]. Distribution: complementary (allophones) vs contrastive (phonemes). Phonological rules describe allophonic variation. Acquisition: infants born able to distinguish all phonemes, specialization occurs by 12 months. Disorders: phonological processing deficits affect reading (dyslexia).
