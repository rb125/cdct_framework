For example, laws against assault or theft are justified, while prohibiting self-destructive behavior is not.

      "text": "The harm principle is a foundational concept in ethics, most notably articulated by philosopher John Stuart Mill. It asserts that the actions of individuals should only be limited to prevent harm to others; personal liberty may be justifiably restricted only when one's conduct poses a risk of significant injury or detriment to another person. Key principles include the prioritization of autonomy, the distinction between self-regarding and other-regarding actions, and the necessity of demonstrable harm for intervention. The harm principle underpins legal and moral frameworks, guiding policies on free speech, drug use, and public health by delineating the boundary between personal freedom and societal protection. Its application requires careful analysis of what constitutes \"harm,\" balancing individual rights with collective welfare, and ensuring that restrictions are proportionate and justified by actual, not hypothetical, threats to others.",
