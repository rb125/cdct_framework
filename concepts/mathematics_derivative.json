For example, the derivative of position with respect to time gives velocity. In calculus, the derivative is often denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx, and it is fundamental for analyzing slopes, optimizing functions, and modeling dynamic systems.",

      "text": "In mathematics, the **derivative** of a function quantifies its instantaneous rate of change with respect to its independent variable. Formally, for a function \\( f(x) \\), the derivative at point \\( x \\) is defined as the limit \\( f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\), provided this limit exists. Key principles include linearity, the product and quotient rules, and the chain rule for composite functions. The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a given point. Derivatives are fundamental in calculus and are widely applied in physics (e.g., velocity as the derivative of position), engineering (e.g., rates of change in systems), economics (e.g., marginal cost), and optimization problems. Higher-order derivatives describe curvature and acceleration, further extending their utility in mathematical analysis and modeling.",
