Key requirements: (1) Variation - individuals differ in traits, (2) Heritability - traits passed to offspring through genes, (3) Selection pressure - environmental factors favor certain traits, (4) Differential fitness - trait differences affect survival/reproduction rates. Mechanisms: directional (shifts mean), stabilizing (reduces variation), disruptive (favors extremes). Time scales: microevolution (within species) to macroevolution (speciation). Evidence: fossil record, comparative anatomy, molecular biology, observed evolution (bacteria, finches). Explains adaptation, biodiversity, complexity without design. Modern synthesis combines with genetics: evolution = change in allele frequencies. Misconceptions: not 'survival of strongest', no predetermined direction, acts on existing variation only.",
