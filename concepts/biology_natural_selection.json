      "text": "Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution in biology, describing the differential survival and reproduction of organisms due to variations in their heritable traits. Individuals possessing advantageous phenotypes\u2014traits that enhance fitness in a given environment\u2014are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing these traits to subsequent generations. Key principles of natural selection include variation (genetic differences among individuals), inheritance (transmission of traits from parents to offspring), differential survival and reproduction (fitness), and adaptation (the process by which populations become better suited to their environment). Over time, natural selection can lead to the evolution of complex adaptations, speciation, and increased biodiversity. Applications of natural selection are evident in fields such as medicine (antibiotic resistance), agriculture (crop improvement), and conservation biology (management of endangered species), where understanding evolutionary dynamics informs practical strategies for addressing biological challenges.",
